            <p class="subtext">The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members of the School of Art community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.</p>

            <p class="subtext">The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that connects Yale undergraduates, particularly those on financial aid, with professional arts practitioners of any discipline. As an option within Yale’s Summer Experience Award (SEA) funding model, the Arts Apprenticeship must fulfill the same basic requirements. Additional details, as well as those specific to the Arts Apprenticeship are included below. Yale faculty, alumni, or other arts practitioners interested in featuring positions through the program should contact Yale’s Creative Careers advisor. Which Opportunities are Eligible? Must be at least 30 hours/week, for at least 8-weeks over the summer months. Those 8-weeks do not have to be continuous if the mentoring Arts Practitioner agrees on a different schedule. The time commitment need not all be in direct contact with the Arts Practitioner. Independent projects, tasks, research, etc. can comprise much of the experience, as long as the Arts Practitioner is checking in regularly with the student to provide oversight and career-based context. The opportunity cannot be with a for-profit organization. The engagement for an Arts Apprenticeship should be directly with an individual Arts Practitioner and not with a company. The only exception to this would be if the company overseeing the apprenticeship were a registered non-profit organization.</p>
