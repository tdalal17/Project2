            <p class="subtext">The Yale School of Art is a graduate institution that awards MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture in addition to providing Yale College students with undergraduate art courses. As a continuing cooperative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing, our website is available. It works like a wiki; anybody who belongs to the School of Art community may upload new material and update the majority of the already existing information.</p>

            <p class="subtext">The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that connects Yale undergraduates, particularly those on financial aid, with professional arts practitioners of any discipline. It is an option within Yaleâ€™s Summer Experience Award (SEA) funding model and must fulfill the same basic requirements. The time commitment must be at least 30 hours/week, for at least 8-weeks over the summer months. Independent projects, tasks, research, etc. can comprise much of the experience, as long as the Arts Practitioner is checking in regularly with the student. The engagement for an Arts Apprenticeship should be directly with an individual Arts Practitioner and not with a company. The only exception to this would be if the company overseeing the apprenticeship were a registered non-profit organization.</p>
